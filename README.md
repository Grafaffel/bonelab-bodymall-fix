# Bonelab Bodymall fix


A workaround for the Avatar BodyMall Favorites Issue where the player gets stuck to the Bodymall, unable to detatch or move if an avatar on their favorites list no longer exists.

> Based on [Stress Level Zero's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia4IL-OgwOY)

> [!WARNING]  
> This is currently only compatible with the PCVR version of BONELAB. Support for Quest will be available soon.

## Usage
