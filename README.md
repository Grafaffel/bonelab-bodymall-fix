# Bonelab Bodymall fix

A workaround for the Avatar BodyMall Favorites Issue where the player gets stuck to the Bodymall, unable to detatch or move if an avatar on their favorites list no longer exists.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is currently only compatible with the PCVR version of BONELAB. Support for Quest might be available soon.
